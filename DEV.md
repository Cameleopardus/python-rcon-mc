## Development notes/TODO:

1. The minecraft interface needs to be prototyped.  Can probably reduce the amount of code greatly with some trickery
2. SSL possible at all with any version of minecraft or RCON? 
3. Improve exception handling in server code.
4. Mark low level commands private?  (not that it matters in Python)
